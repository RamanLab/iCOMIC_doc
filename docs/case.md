## 10. iCOMIC Tutorial

#### 10.1. What is it?
`iCOMIC` (Integrating Context Of Mutation In Cancer) an open-source, standalone tool for genomic data analysis characterized by a Python-based Graphical User Interface and automated Bioinformatics pipelines for DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq data analysis. It serves as a point and click application facilitating genomic data analysis accessible to researchers with minimal programming expertise. iCOMIC takes in raw sequencing data in FASTQ format as an input, and finally outputs insightful statistics on it’s nature. iCOMIC toolkit is embedded in `‘Snakemake’`, a workflow management system. iCOMIC is characterized by a user-friendly GUI built using `PyQt5` which increases its ease of access. The toolkit features many independent core workflows in both whole genomic and transcriptomic data analysis pipelines.
