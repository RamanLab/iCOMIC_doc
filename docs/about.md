## About
iCOMIC is a user-friendly pipeline to analyze genomic data that takes in raw sequencing data in FASTQ format as an input, and finally outputs insightful statistics on it’s nature. iCOMIC toolkit is capable of analyzing both Whole Genome and transcriptome data and is embedded in ‘Snakemake’, a workflow management system. iCOMIC is characterized by a user-friendly GUI built using PyQt5 which increases its ease of access. The toolkit features many independent core workflows in both whole genomic and transcriptomic data analysis pipelines.
